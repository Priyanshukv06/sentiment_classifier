# Sentiment Classifier

## Overview
This project is a sentiment analysis tool designed to classify movie reviews into **positive** or **negative** categories. The model uses a Logistic Regression classifier trained on a dataset of IMDb movie reviews. It applies natural language processing techniques to preprocess and vectorize the text data, followed by training the model to predict sentiments accurately.

## Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares raw text data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses Word2Vec embeddings to represent text in vector form.
- **Model Training**: Logistic Regression classifier is used for sentiment classification.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and classification report metrics.
